# 🚀 **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD**

## 🇮🇳 **RISC-V VSD Participants India**

Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**!  

This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks inside each week.  

> "In this program, we learn to design a **System-on-Chip (SoC)** from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools.  
> Part of India's largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering **3500+ participants** to build silicon and advance the nation's semiconductor ecosystem."
